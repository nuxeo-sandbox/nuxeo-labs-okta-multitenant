# About

This Nuxeo Package contains a custom resolver for Okta to map Okta user profile to Nuxeo profile with support for the Nuxeo Multi Tenant add-on.

# Limitations

The mapping is "fixed"; it assumes the only fields that will be used from Okta are:

* email (also used for the user id)
* firstName
* lastName
* organization (used as tenant id)
* groups

# Requirements

Build requires the following software:
- git
- maven

# Build

```
git clone https://github.com/nuxeo-sandbox/nuxeo-labs-okta-multitenant
cd nuxeo-labs-okta-multitenant
mvn clean install
```

# Deploy

Install the marketplace package using the Admin center or using `nuxeoctl`.

## Support

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
